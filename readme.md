# Sign Language Translator
## A translator which converts English characters into the Sign Language alphabet.

### Generates sign language images from text. This translator converts text into fingerspelling (and numbers) only. It essentially translates the regular alphabet into the  "hand alphabet" or "finger alphabet", which is a manual alphabet that is two-handed.
